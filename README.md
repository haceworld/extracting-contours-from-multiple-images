# extracting-contours-from-multiple-images

Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.

The code is put together to reads multiple images from a folder, extracts contours, and save them in another folder.
Remember to make changes to the path folder directory. The result of the code is presented below:
